# Workshop Promotion
Proposal for redesign of https://www.opensourceecology.org/ landing pages and sign up. In an effort to keep the web site up–to–date with current requirements that users demand, and google requires. Speed and access are of utmost importance in a world of hand held devices connected to the 3rd, 4th, or now even 5th generation of network capabilities. New users are only willing to wait fractions of seconds for load time.


# Global Components
Design elements that will need to be constant across all pages of the site.

## Header
Described best as top section of the website, a tiny index that should give you access to every corner of the site. Accessible almost all the time, hence the global title.

## Footer
Sitting below everything on the page, the footer acts similar to the header. Giving more options to subscribe and search.
