# Workshop Promotion
Proposal for redesign of https://www.opensourceecology.org/ landing pages and sign up. In an effort to keep the web site up–to–date with current requirements that users demand, and google requires. Speed and access are of utmost importance in a world of hand held devices connected to the 3rd, 4th, or now even 5th generation of network capabilities. New users are only willing to wait fractions of seconds for load time.
